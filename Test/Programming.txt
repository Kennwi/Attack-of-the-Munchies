1. A scalar is one specific variable, only one of something and can be used when you want to only allude to one variable. A Hash is a big collection of key pairs, with every key being unique, and can
be used as an orginizational tool when looking at big pieces of data/input. And an Array basically a list of data, and can be used to keep track of different pieces of data.

2. A strongly typed language is a language where the varibale has to be declared and that variable can only hold that specific data, i.e @foo = (3,5,15,20). $foo is a variable only able to hold numbers
An example of this languages would be Java or C++. 
A loosely typed language is a language where the variable of course still has to be declared, but thayt variable can hold any data the programmer wants it to. i.e @baz = (3,'bear', 50, 'cat')
Some examples of this language would be Perl and Python.

3. A stack is basically a list, where you listed all that you want in that stack, but when you go to have it output the data whichever piece of data was last going in is first coming out. An example 
of this in the real world could be an elevator, usually the last person coming onto an elevator is the first to come out. Another could be a STACK of cans, the last can going on top, is the first can 
coming off the stack. A queue is the same as a stack really, the only difference being that it's data comes out in order, the last piece of data going in is just added to the queue, while the first 
piece going in, is the first piece off. For example, whenever you visit a deli and the tell you to take a number, and they attend to the customers following numerical order.

4. Git is a way that programmers can keep track of their projects, and easily access them easily with reocrds of the changes made, it also makes collaboration alot easier.
